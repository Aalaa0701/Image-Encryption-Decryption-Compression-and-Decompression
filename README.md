### About The Project
This project is a software that encodes images using the **Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR)** algorithm and compresses the encoded image using **Huffman encoding**. It allows users to enter an alphanumeric password as a register for encoding. Additionally, an algorithm is implemented to crack the encoded image without needing the original key.

This project was developed as part of the algorithm course at Ain Shams University.

### Features
- **Image Encoding**: Encrypts an image using the LFSR algorithm.
- **Huffman Compression**: Compresses the encoded image.
- **Custom Register**: Accepts alphanumeric passwords as the encoding register.
- **Cracking Algorithm**: Recovers the encoded image without the original key.

---

### Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: C#
- **Algorithms**: Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR), Huffman Encoding
- **Development Tools**: Visual Studio

---

### How It Works
1. **LFSR Encoding**: The image is encrypted using a bit-shift and feedback mechanism defined by the LFSR algorithm.
2. **Huffman Compression**: The encoded image is then compressed to minimize space usage.
3. **Custom Register**: Users can input an alphanumeric password which is converted into a binary register for the LFSR.
4. **Cracking Algorithm**: The software uses a brute force or heuristic algorithm to crack the encoded image without needing the original password, allowing image data recovery.

### Test Cases
Here are some examples of test cases that the project successfully passes. These images demonstrate the encoding, compression, decoding, and cracking processes.

#### 1. **Original Image**
*The original unencoded image.*

#### 2. **Encoded & Comprissed Image**
*The image after LFSR encryption.*

#### 3. **Decoded Image**
*The image was successfully decoded and decomprised using the original key.*

### How to Use

#### Encoding an Image:
- Run the program, input your alphanumeric password, and choose the image file in .bmb format you want to encode.
- The output will be an encrypted and compressed image file (a text file containing the bits of the image and the Huffman table for decompression).

#### Decoding with a Key:
- If you have the password, you can decrypt the image back to its original form (you should select the text file generated by the encryption).

#### Cracking the Encoded Image:
- For images encoded without the key, the cracking algorithm can attempt to recover the image by analyzing the structure of the encoded data(you should select the text file generated by the encryption).
